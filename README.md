# Words Are Hard
---
As f/e developers we often have to name different components and blocks in an agnostic and descriptive manner. Naming things can be really, really hard. This is a small list I put together.

If you are following a block, element, modifier pattern in your CSS, these could be used to help the _block_ portion of that sequence.


### Individual Blocks
- block
- box
- module
